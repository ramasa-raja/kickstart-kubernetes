# Kubernetes Basics – My Lab Notes

This repository started as a fork of the SloopStash kickstart-kubernetes project.  
I use it as a small lab to try out:

- Deploying sample workloads on Kubernetes  
- Readiness / liveness probes  
- HPA behaviour under load  
- Different ways of structuring manifests

I keep small changes and examples here so I can quickly revisit patterns that helped me during real incidents and migrations.

# Kickstart Kubernetes
Our Kubernetes starter-kit repository contains Kubernetes YAML templates, Vagrant VM configurations, workload-specific configurations, etc., required to automate and run containerized workloads in the Kubernetes cluster.
